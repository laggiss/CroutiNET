"""

Script modified from amaury's downloader.py.  Specifically this randomly selects a point within a road segment for each road segment.
Then, from that list of random points, a subset is randomly selected for downlading.  For each point with more than one
available panorama, a single one is randomly selected for download at a given location.

A shapefile must be available with the random points and must contain the downstreet bearing as well as a field that identifies
each road segment.

I used polyline to segment tool in arcgis, followed by the add geometry bearing tool and finally the vertices to segments and a spatial join from segments to vertices
to create the shapefile used here.
